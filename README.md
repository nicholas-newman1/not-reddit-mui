## Skills Developed ##
When I started this project, I had no idea how to implement a backend. This severely limited the complexity of my projects. I learned Firebase, which allowed me to further develop my front end skills by making a more complex application.

Some of those skills included:
- __Conditional rendering__ depending on whether a user is logged in and has __authorization__
- Firebase __security rules__, __server side functions__, and __authentication__
- Using __functional components__ with __hooks__ (as well as __custom hooks__)
- __Fetch__ data from a database, store it in __state__, and display it in a component
- Collecting data from __forms__ and making __read/write requests__ to the database
- Manageing state with __Redux Toolkit__
- Catching type errors with __TypeScript__
- Writing and recognizing the value of __unit & integration tests__
- Keeping file structure __organized__ and making components as __reusable__ as possible
- Styling with __Material UI__ for rapid UI development
